# TheDump

TheDump is basically just a code dump - a collection of random projects I’ve made over time.

Most of these were made for fun, boredom, or experimentation. Some are prototypes, some are just weird little ideas I wanted to try out. A lot of them were made with the help of ChatGPT or other tools, but they all represent things I’ve actually built or tinkered with.

This repo is kind of a nostalgia trip and a way to clean up my GitHub, showing what I’m capable of while also bringing back some old favorites.

⚠️ Warning: Most projects are not polished or production-ready.


THERE IS NOTHING ELSE ADDED HERE, THESE ARE THE RAW PROJECTS FROZEN IN TIME!
